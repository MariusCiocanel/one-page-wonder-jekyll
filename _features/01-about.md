Guardwell Crescent was built by Bellway Homes Limited between 1995 and 2000. The estate comprises 206 properties, although house numbers are higher than this due to an imbalance between the number of odd and even houses. The houses are laid out along the main street, Guardwell Crescent, with several cul de sacs leading off the Crescent as well as strategically located open green spaces for children’s play.

Guardwell Crescent is located in Liberton on the south side of Edinburgh. Is is off Gilmerton Road and is about a 10 minute drive from the city centre (3.75 miles/6 km) and a 25 minute drive from Edinburgh Airport (11 miles/18 km). It is serviced by Lothian Buses numbers 3, 8, 18, 29 and N3, and is convenient for access to the City Bypass.

Guardwell Crescent also enjoys close access to nature walks at Braid Hill, Blackford Hill, Inch Park and Burdiehouse Burn. Slightly further afield Holyrood Park (Arthur’s Seat), the Meadows and the Pentlands also offer good walking opportunities.

There is good representation of schooling in the area from nursery to high school. Nearby shopping centres include the shops at Newington, the Cameron Toll Shopping Centre, the Straiton Retail Park and the Fort Kinnaird Shopping Centre at Newcraighall. Nearby recreation facilities include Liberton Golf Club, Gracemount Leisure Centre and The Royal Commonwealth Pool. The Royal Infirmary (hospital) at Little France, the Kings Buildings of University of Edinburgh and the Scottish Parliament are also close by.

Guardwell Crescent is a factored community which maintains a Residents' Association and elected Residents' Association Committee. Decisions relating to the management and maintenance of Guardwell Crescent are voted upon at Annual General Meetings with each houshold within the Guardwell community contributing an annual fee towards the maintenance of common community property. The Guardwell community also maintains an active Neighbourhod Watch which disseminates news and local police reports to households.
